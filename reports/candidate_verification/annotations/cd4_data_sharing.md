MuData object containing genome-wide differential expression results computed independently for each individual sgRNA guide (rather than aggregating across guides). Two modalities, named by the alphanumeric rank of the guide ID within each (perturbed gene, culture condition) pair:

- `guide_1` — DE results from the first guide of each (perturbed gene, culture condition) pair (sgRNA IDs sorted alphanumerically; lowest = `guide_1`).  
- `guide_2` — DE results from the second guide. Targets tested with only a single passing guide are present in `guide_1` and missing from `guide_2`.

Each modality is an AnnData with the same `.obs`, `.var`, and `.layers` schema as `GWCD4i.DE_stats.h5ad` (see "Differential Expression Results" above for column descriptions). The observation key is `{target_contrast}_{culture_condition}`.


## Donor-pair differential expression results

Filename: `GWCD4i.DE_stats.by_donors.h5mu`

Each modality is an AnnData with the same `.obs`, `.var`, and `.layers` schema as `GWCD4i.DE_stats.h5ad` (see "Differential Expression Results" above for column descriptions). The observation key is `{target_contrast}_{culture_condition}`.

### TCR-signalling cluster arrayed validation bulk RNA-seq differential expression results

Filename: `clusterTCR_deseq2_results.csv.gz`

Full DESeq2 differential expression results from bulk RNA-seq of arrayed CRISPRi validation experiments for regulators clustering with the core TCR-signalling machinery. A separate model was fit within each culture condition (design `~ donor + PC1 + target_gene`, restricted to protein-coding genes), where `PC1` is the first principal component computed within that condition's samples and used as a sequencing-depth covariate, and the replicate batch is folded into the donor label so it is absorbed by the donor term.
